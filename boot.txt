To boot RDOS

1. On the Tandy, go into the BASIC interpreter and type
LOAD "COM:98N1D
and press enter.
Then press the button on the RDOS drive.

This will load the RLOAD.BA program from the RDOS drive.

Once loaded, type
SAVE "RLOAD

2. Optionally, load the other RDOS programs by running RLOAD.
The files on the RDOS drive are:
RSAVE.BA - Allows you to save files to the RDOS drive
RLIST.BA - Allows you to list the files on the RDOS drive
RUTIL.BA - Allows you to rename/delete files, change working directory on the RDOS drive.

You only need to load the programs you want.  If you don't care about renaming/deleting files, you don't have to load RUTIL, for example.

They will be loaded as .DO files.  So, you would do
LOAD "Rxxx.DO
then
SAVE "Rxxx
KILL "Rxxx.DO

Example run:
What file to get from drive? RSAVE.BA
What to name it on the Tandy? RSAVE

LOAD "RSAVE.DO
SAVE "RSAVE
KILL "RSAVE.DO
